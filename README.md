# PROJECT NAME HERE

The Math Melee

### GROUP NAME HERE

1. Michael Avrahami
       
### Project Description:

My project is to code a math tournament between as many players as are able to join. Each player will face one opponent, single elimination style until there is one winner. 
The idea is that the first player will be given two random numbers, 1-500. They will have 5-10 seconds to add those two numbers and type in the result. If they do so successfully, the game will go to the other player. This time, they will receive the sum the last player just returned and another random number, 1-200. They will have to type in the sum of those two numbers in 5-10 seconds. This goes on until someone makes the first mistake, and they lose.
The tournament progresses single-elimination until there is one final victor.
